# Features

Silent Mate offers intelligent, automatic audio profile switching based on how you hold and place your device.

## Core Features

### Three Detection Modes

Silent Mate can detect three distinct phone positions and automatically adjust your audio profile accordingly.

### Event Scheduling

**Create Scheduled Audio Profiles:**

Silent Mate allows you to schedule audio profiles for specific times and locations, perfect for:
- Regular meetings or classes
- Gym sessions
- Sleep schedule
- Work hours
- Any recurring event

**Event Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Event Name** | Custom label for the event | "Monday Meeting", "Gym Time" |
| **Time** | Start and end time | 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM |
| **Location** | Optional location name | "Conference Room", "Gym" |
| **Recurrence** | Repeat pattern | Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Custom |
| **Audio Profile** | Desired mode | Silent, Vibration, General |

**How It Works:**
1. Create event with name, time, location, and recurrence
2. Select desired audio profile for that event
3. App automatically switches profiles when event time arrives
4. Switches back to sensor-based detection when event ends

**Event Priority:**
- Scheduled events override sensor-based detection
- Multiple overlapping events: Latest created takes priority
- Events can be enabled/disabled individually
- Works alongside sensor switching

**Use Cases:**
- **Work Meetings:** Silent mode during scheduled meetings
- **Gym Sessions:** General mode for music playback
- **Sleep Time:** Silent mode from 11 PM to 7 AM
- **Classes:** Silent mode during class hours
- **Commute:** Vibration mode during travel time

#### 📱 On Desk Detection

**What it does:**
- Detects when your phone is lying flat, face-up on a surface
- Automatically switches to **Silent Mode** 🔇

**How it works:**
- Monitors Z-axis acceleration (gravity)
- Checks for minimal movement (device is stable)
- Confirms face-up orientation

**Perfect for:**
- During meetings or presentations
- While working at your desk
- During sleep time
- In quiet environments (libraries, theaters)

**Technical Details:**
- **Trigger:** Z-axis > 7 (face-up) + movement < 0.1 (very stable)
- **Result:** RINGER_MODE_SILENT
- **Notification:** Silent notification (no sound/vibration)

#### 👖 In Pocket Detection

**What it does:**
- Detects when your phone is in your pocket or bag
- Automatically switches to **Vibration Mode** 📳

**How it works:**
- Uses proximity sensor to detect nearby objects
- Confirms face-down orientation (screen facing inward)
- Validates with accelerometer data

**Perfect for:**
- Walking around with phone in pocket
- Phone in a bag or purse
- Face-down on a table
- When you need discrete notifications

**Technical Details:**
- **Trigger:** Proximity < 5cm + Z-axis between -3 and -12 (face-down)
- **Fallback:** Proximity < 2cm (very close)
- **Result:** RINGER_MODE_VIBRATE
- **Notification:** Vibration pattern [0, 800, 300, 800]ms

---

#### 🤚 In Hand Detection

**What it does:**
- Detects when you're actively holding or using your phone
- Automatically switches to **General Mode** 🔊

**How it works:**
- Monitors accelerometer for face-up orientation
- Detects movement from gyroscope data
- Distinguishes between holding and active use

**Perfect for:**
- When you pick up your phone
- While browsing or texting
- During active phone use
- When you want full sound and vibration

**Technical Details:**
- **Trigger:** Z-axis 5-12 (face-up) + movement > 0.05 (holding) or > 0.5 (active)
- **Result:** RINGER_MODE_NORMAL
- **Notification:** Sound + vibration
- **Volume Check:** Ensures ring volume > 0, sets to 50% if muted

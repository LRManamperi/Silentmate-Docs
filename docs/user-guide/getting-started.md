## Understanding Silent Mate's Two Modes

Silent Mate offers **two powerful ways** to manage your audio profiles:

### 1. 📡 Sensor-Based Audio Switching

**How it works:**
- Uses phone sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, proximity)
- Automatically detects phone position
- Switches audio profile based on position

**Three Detection Modes:**

| Position | Sensors Used | Audio Profile |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| 📱 **On Desk** | Accelerometer + Gyroscope | Silent 🔇 |
| 👖 **In Pocket** | Proximity + Accelerometer | Vibration 📳 |
| 🤚 **In Hand** | Accelerometer + Gyroscope | General 🔊 |

**Enable/Disable:**
- Navigate to Sensor screen (bottom navigation, center icon)
- Toggle individual detection modes
- Real-time sensor data displayed

![Sensor Screen](../assets/SensorbasedCSPage.jpg)

---

### 2. ⏰ Event-Based Audio Switching

**How it works:**
- Schedule audio profiles for specific times/locations
- Create recurring events (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Automatic profile switching when event starts

**Perfect for:**
- Regular meetings or classes
- Gym sessions  
- Sleep schedule
- Work hours
- Commute times

## Audio Profile Switching Modes

### Sensor-Based Switching

![Sensor Screen](../assets/SensorbasedCSPage.jpg)

**Access:** Bottom navigation → Center icon (📡)

**Individual Mode Toggles:**

1. **On Desk** 📱
   - **When:** Phone lying face-up, stable
   - **Profile:** Silent Mode 🔇
   - **Sensors:** Accelerometer (Z-axis > 7) + Gyroscope (movement < 0.1)
   - **Use case:** During work, meetings, sleep

2. **In Pocket** 👖
   - **When:** Phone face-down + proximity sensor detects nearby object
   - **Profile:** Vibration Mode 📳
   - **Sensors:** Proximity (< 5cm) + Accelerometer (Z between -3 and -12)
   - **Use case:** Walking, phone in bag/pocket

3. **In Hand** 🤚
   - **When:** Phone face-up with movement
   - **Profile:** General Mode 🔊
   - **Sensors:** Accelerometer (Z 5-12) + Gyroscope (movement > 0.05)
   - **Use case:** Browsing, texting, active use

**Debug Information:**
- **Z:** Z-axis acceleration (gravity direction)
- **Prox:** Proximity sensor distance (cm)
- **Move:** Movement magnitude from gyroscope
- **Pos:** Currently detected position

**How to Use:**
1. Toggle ON desired detection modes
2. Place phone in different positions to test
3. Watch real-time sensor values update
4. Position and profile display at top

### Event-Based Switching

**Access:** Home screen → Settings (⚙️)

![Settings - Event Toggle](../assets/Settings.jpg)

**Event-based Audio Switching** ⏰
- Toggle ON to enable scheduled events
- Toggle OFF to disable all events (sensor-only mode)
- Located at bottom of Settings screen
- Events still saved when disabled

---

## Priority System

When both modes are enabled:

**Priority Order:**
1. 🥇 **Active Events** (Highest)
   - Scheduled events override sensor detection
   - While event is active, sensors are paused
   
2. 🥈 **Sensor Detection** (Medium)
   - Works when no event is active
   - Continuously monitors phone position

3. 🥉 **Manual Override** (User Control)
   - You can manually change audio mode anytime
   - Will be overridden by next event/sensor change

**Example Scenario:**
```
9:00 AM - Event starts: "Meeting" (Silent Mode)
         → Audio switches to Silent
         → Sensor detection paused

9:30 AM - Event ends
         → Sensor detection resumes
         → If phone in hand: Switches to General
         → If phone on desk: Stays Silent
         → If phone in pocket: Switches to Vibration

10:00 AM - No events active
          → Fully sensor-controlled
          → Changes with phone position
```
